A simple-interest yielding bank account in Leo.

## Summary

This program implements a bank that issues tokens to users and allows users to deposit tokens to accrue simple interest on their deposits.

### User Flow
1. The bank issues users tokens via the `issue` function.
2. A user deposits tokens via the `deposit` function.
3. Upon a user's request to withdraw, the bank calculates the appropriate amount of compound interest and pays the user the principal and interest via the `withdraw` function.

Note that the program can be easily extended to include addition features such as a `transfer` function, which would allow users to transfer tokens to other users.

## Bugs

You may have already guessed that this program has a few bugs. We list some of them below: 
- `withdraw` can only be invoked by the bank. A malicious bank could lock users' tokens by not invoking `withdraw`.
- `withdraw` fails if the sum of the interest and principal is greater than the user's balance. 
- User's can increase their principal by depositing tokens multiple times, including immediately before withdrawal.
- Integer division rounds down; if the calculated interest is too small, then it will be rounded down to zero.

Can you find any others?

## Language Features and Concepts
- `record` declarations
- `assert_eq`
- core functions, e.g. `BHP256::hash`
- record ownership
- loops and bounded iteration
- mappings
- finalize

## How to Run

Follow the [Leo Installation Instructions](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/installation).

This basic bank program can be run using the following bash script. Locally, it will execute Leo program functions to issue, deposit, and withdraw tokens between a bank and a user.

```bash
cd basic_bank
./run.sh
```

The `.env` file contains a private key and address. This is the account that will be used to sign transactions and is checked for record ownership. When executing programs as different parties, be sure to set the `private_key` field in `.env` to the appropriate value. You can check out how we've set things up in `./run.sh` for a full example of how to run the program as different parties.

## Walkthrough

* [Step 0: Issue Tokens](#issue)
* [Step 1: Deposit Tokens](#deposit)
* [Step 2: Wait](#wait)
* [Step 3: Withdraw Tokens](#withdraw)

## <a id="issue"></a> Issue Tokens

We will be playing the role of two parties.

```bash
The private key and address of the bank.
private_key: APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
address: aleo1rhgdu77hgyqd3xjj8ucu3jj9r2krwz6mnzyd80gncr5fxcwlh5rsvzp9px

The private key and address of the user.
private_key: APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
address: aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t
```

Let's make some bank transactions. We'll take the role of the bank and issue 100 tokens to the user. We swap the private key into `.env` and run the `issue` transition function. The inputs are simply the recipient of the issuance and the amount.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run issue aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t 100u64
```

## <a id="deposit"></a> Deposit Tokens

Now, let's have the user deposit 50 of their tokens with the bank. We'll take the role of the user and call the deposit function, having the user use the output record that was issued to them by the bank. The inputs are the output record from the `issue` transition and the amount the user wishes to deposit.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run deposit "{
    owner: aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t.private,
    amount: 100u64.private,
    _nonce: 4668394794828730542675887906815309351994017139223602571716627453741502624516group.public
}"  50u64
```

You'll see that the output contains a new private record belonging to the user with 50 credits, and a finalize `deposit` function taking the arguments (bank address, amount) that will update a public mapping with 50 credits. This information is queryable on-chain.

## <a id="wait"></a> Wait

With the 50 token deposit, let's say 15 periods of time pass with compounding interest at a rate of 12.34% on the principal amount.

You can run the calculation yourself, it comes out to 266 tokens accrued using those numbers. 

## <a id="withdraw"></a> Withdraw Tokens

Now, let's have the bank withdraw all tokens after 15 periods. Let's switch to the bank role, and call the `withdraw` transition function. The inputs are the recipient's address, amount, rate, and periods.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run withdraw aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t 50u64 1234u64 15u64
```

You'll see here the withdrawal function creates a new private record for the user containing all 266 withdrawn tokens, and then calls the finalize `withdraw` function with arguments (address, amount), which will update the public balance of the bank back to 0. The public mapping will be queryable on-chain.
