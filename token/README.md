## Summary

A transparent & shielded custom token in Leo.

## How to Run

Follow the [Leo Installation Instructions](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/installation).

This token program can be run using the following bash script. Locally, it will execute Leo program functions to mint and transfer tokens publicly and privately.


```bash
cd token
./run.sh
```

The `.env` file contains a private key and address. This is the account that will be used to sign transactions and is checked for record ownership. When executing programs as different parties, be sure to set the `private_key` field in `.env` to the appropriate value. You can check out how we've set things up in `./run.sh` for a full example of how to run the program as different parties.

## Walkthrough

* [Step 0: Public Mint](#step0)
* [Step 1: Private Mint](#step1)
* [Step 2: Public Transfer](#step2)
* [Step 3: Private Transfer](#step3)
* [Step 4: Public to Private Transfer](#step4)
* [Step 5: Private to Public Transfer](#step5)

We'll be conducting a transfer between two parties.

```bash
The private key and address of Alice.
private_key: APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
address: aleo1rhgdu77hgyqd3xjj8ucu3jj9r2krwz6mnzyd80gncr5fxcwlh5rsvzp9px

The private key and address of Bob.
private_key: APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
address: aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t
```

## <a id="step0"></a> Public Mint

Let's play Alice. Swap in her private key and publicly mint 100 tokens.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run mint_public aleo1rhgdu77hgyqd3xjj8ucu3jj9r2krwz6mnzyd80gncr5fxcwlh5rsvzp9px 100u64
```

You can see the output of the finalize function of `mint_public`, which takes the arguments Alice's address and the amount of tokens to mint publicly. This information is shown on-chain and can be queried on a network.

## <a id="step1"></a> Private Mint

Now let's privately mint 100 tokens for Bob. Switch to Bob's private key and privately mint 100 tokens for Bob.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run mint_private aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t 100u64
```

The output is a private record.

## <a id="step2"></a> Public Transfer

Let's publicly transfer 10 tokens from Alice to Bob. Swap the private key back to Alice and call the public transfer transition.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run transfer_public aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t 10u64
```

Again, we see the arguments used for the finalize function of `transfer_public` - Alice's address, Bob's address, and the amount to transfer. The public mapping will be queryable on-chain.

## <a id="step3"></a> Private Transfer

Let's privately transfer 20 tokens from Bob to Alice. Switch to Bob's private key and call the private transfer transition.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run transfer_private "{
    owner: aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t.private,
    amount: 100u64.private,
    _nonce: 6586771265379155927089644749305420610382723873232320906747954786091923851913group.public
}" aleo1rhgdu77hgyqd3xjj8ucu3jj9r2krwz6mnzyd80gncr5fxcwlh5rsvzp9px 20u64
```

The output of `transfer_private` is a record owned by Bob less the 20 tokens he privately transferred to Alice, and a record owned by Alice with the 20 tokens Bob transferred to Alice.

## <a id="step4"></a> Public to Private Transfer

Let's convert 30 of Alice's public tokens into 30 private tokens for Bob. Switch the private key back to Alice.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp8CZNn3yeCseEtxuVPbDCwSyhGW6yZKUYKfgXmcpoGPWH
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run transfer_public_to_private aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t 30u64
```

When calling `transfer_public_to_private`, we see the finalize function with the arguments to modify Alice's public token mapping (address, amount), and a private record created that's owned by Bob and contains 110 tokens.

## <a id="step5"></a> Private to Public Transfer

Let's convert 40 of Bob's private tokens into 40 public tokens for Alice. Switch the private key back to Bob.

```bash
echo "
NETWORK=testnet
PRIVATE_KEY=APrivateKey1zkp2RWGDcde3efb89rjhME1VYA8QMxcxep5DShNBR6n8Yjh
ENDPOINT=https://api.explorer.aleo.org/v1
" > .env

leo run transfer_private_to_public "{
    owner: aleo1s3ws5tra87fjycnjrwsjcrnw2qxr8jfqqdugnf0xzqqw29q9m5pqem2u4t.private,
    amount: 80u64.private,
    _nonce: 1852830456042139988098466781381363679605019151318121788109768539956661608520group.public
}" aleo1rhgdu77hgyqd3xjj8ucu3jj9r2krwz6mnzyd80gncr5fxcwlh5rsvzp9px 40u64
```

When we call `transfer_private_to_public`, we take Bob's private record that contains 110 tokens, and outputs a record owned by Bob with 70 tokens, and calls the finalize function under `transfer_private_to_public` with Alice's address and 40 tokens as arguments. This changes the public mapping under Alice's address to contain 100 public tokens. Again, public mappings are queryable on-chain.
